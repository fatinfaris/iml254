	<h2>Hey there!</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I‚Äôm FatinFaris, and I‚Äôm here to share a little piece of myself with you.</p>

        <p>I was born in Hospital Pakar Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru, and I‚Äôm the third child of four. My parents split when I was 10, and my mom brought me to stay in my hometown, Muar, Johor. Till now, I‚Äôm living in Muar with my mom, stepdad, and my other siblings.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôm known as the yapper in my family because I never stop talking. Growing up, I lived the life of being the favorite kid in my big family on both my father‚Äôs and mother‚Äôs sides. I was always the confident kid who felt pretty and loved herself. However, growing up has its challenges. Being the friend who‚Äôs always there when needed, left behind by everyone, and even being the joke to others, has taken a toll on my confidence.</p>
        <p>Now, I identify as an introvert with an MBTI of INFP. My energy gets easily depleted, and I need to recharge after interacting with people. People often say, ‚Äúapproaching you is the hardest thing because you seem so cold,‚Äù ‚Äúyou look so unbothered,‚Äù and ‚Äúyou seem aloof.‚Äù But when I‚Äôm with people I‚Äôm comfortable with, I become the hyper, yapper girl again.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>More about me ñ†ã</h1>
        <p>When I‚Äôm not buried in gadgets, you‚Äôll find me nose-deep in a good book or jamming to my favorite tunes. I‚Äôm a total movie buff, too, and discovering new films is my jam! One of my all-time favorite books is "Luna" by Anya Jayvyn, and I‚Äôve got this killer Spotify playlist I hit up whenever I need to unwind.</p>
        <p>Right now, I‚Äôm studying at UiTM Kedah, pursuing a diploma in Library Informatics. I‚Äôm currently in my fourth semester, aiming high with my education. I‚Äôve got big dreams for my career in tech and can‚Äôt wait to dive into projects that make a difference. My ultimate mission is to mix my love for tech and creativity to turn cool ideas into reality.</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by my website! Feel free to explore more about my hobbies, education, and adventures through the links above. Let‚Äôs stay connected and keep the good vibes rolling!</p>
